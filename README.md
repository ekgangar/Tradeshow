Tradeshow exhibitor booking payment online system
I have created this repository for a solution asked from my client about floor plan booking system for regular events.
Setting up plan for visiting to website and guiding to open particular event, and choose the place needed and fill up the required documents. the payment tab will be enabled when admin confirms that he can go forward with payment.(or if he selected the stall of his choice all calculation should show up to him for payment, like if a stall is 20 sq ft. , and price for 1 sq. ft. is $5 then he will have to pay 20 * 5 with calucation estimater shown. 
next when the size is selected ,he will need to sign up before making payment, the added to cart should remain there even after and before registration. check out without registration disabled.
registration process will have a documentation required field. 
now as the registration is complete he can now make payment, automatic invoiceing is needed here with proper gst integration.
now there will be interfaces. <SUPER ADMIN>(that manages all clients) <CLIENTs> <ADMIN> <Employess> <CUSTOMER>
  What a Client needs to be shown
  
  What an admin will be seeing
  What an employee will see
  what a customer will see
  a customer will get to see add photo option and add few customized detail things, as he adds details a automatic profile should be created for public view with a customizable link .check username type thing.
  secondly a customer can browse other events of intrest up coming events, testimonials, videos and how to use  and what to bring, book hotel from there in, book journey,that can be full embedded in it or can be linked to other platform via api or directly forward the traffic there.
  a customer now can see about his payment history, payment schedule, next installment, add credit card, autopayment option,balance payment option.
  importantly now customer will be given view of add on items he can buy like chairs, lights, furtinure, led,etc. can customize quantity and apply promo discount pop should be der.
  what an employee will see, a employee can book stall on a behalve of asomeone but as he books a log should be created that this person has made booking and an amount will be tagged to him for clearanvce need to be done, and he will be assigned the particular client and he will be made admin of that particular user. or more advanced view an admin can only assign user to employee.so that it do not create conflict between employees as employee 1 now can not book a stall for user that is assigned to employee 2.
employee can now manage call logs and meeting scheduler for next follow ups with the client.
what an admin can see and do. an admin can change any privalages assigned to any one. he can delete edit events.can clear any ones payment, can make discount coupons.can create event, assign payment options, in other words can do anything. but can not customize any basic operation of the application.
even a client delete the event it should not get deleted from super admin. super admin still can see all things happenieng under him all time , even if a client cleared payment for some one , a log will be created and will always be available with full path and event process timming ip , who did it , who approved it log.

starting with the project I am looking for open source , as they give the liberty of doing anything. thanks fto the creator. credit notes will always be assigned to creator as powered by or will think later.
